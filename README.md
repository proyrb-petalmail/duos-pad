# Duos-Pad

This is a project for building the `Desktop` system which will be launched on `Milk-V DuoS`.

`Milk-V DuoS` is an upgraded model of `Duo`, which has upgraded the `SG2000` controller and has larger memory (`512MB`) and more IO interfaces. It integrates `WI-FI 6`/`BT 5` wireless functionality and is equipped with a USB 2.0 HOST interface and a 100Mbps Ethernet port, making it convenient for users to use. It supports dual cameras (2x MIPI CSI 2-channel) and MIPI video output (MIPI DSI 4-channel), enabling multiple applications. DuoS also supports switching between `RISC-V` and `ARM` startup through a switch. By enhancing performance and interfaces, `DuoS` is more suitable for various scenarios and more complex project development requirements.

The chip also integrates an internal `TPU`, which can provide approximately `0.5 TOPS` of computing power under `INT8` operation. The specially designed `TPU` scheduling engine efficiently provides high bandwidth data streams for tensor processing unit cores. It also provides users with a powerful deep learning model compiler and software SDK development kit. Mainstream deep learning frameworks such as Caffe, Pytorch, ONNX, MXNet, TensorFlow (Lite) can be easily ported to this platform.
